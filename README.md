# go-checkout-service
Checkout Service written in Go. It is run alongside `checkout-client` which is another one of my repos. The idea behind them is a simple checkout application for buying 3 types of items, with a certain discount logic behind multiple instances of the same item, as well as certain combination of items (offers).  

**Note:**
This development is the first time I ever used Golang before actually studying it.
